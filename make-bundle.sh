# So.
#
# What's the easiest way to run a Meteor app on a server, with:
# - Automated Mongo setup and management, including oplog setup and
#   authentication.
# - Correct versions of Node and Mongo.
# - Insulation from possibly-old Debian platform libraries.
# - Listen sockets bound externally and passed in as file descriptors.
# - Ability to update to a new app version seamlessly.
# - Init scripts.
# - Convenient admin access to Mongo shell.
#
# Well, it turns out that Sandstorm has solved all these problems in its
# bundle runner / updater.
#
# And it turns out that if you take a Sandstorm bundle and simply swap out the
# Meteor part with any other Meteor app, you get all the same advantages. Yes,
# you end up with the Sandstorm backend running for no reason (it won't be
# used), but your Meteor app will run nicely.
#
# So this script does exactly that: Takes a Sandstorm bundle and swaps out the
# Sandstorm shell for the App Market. To set up the app market, install
# Sandstorm on a server, then "update" it to an app market bundle.
#
# This is how we actually run the app market in production.
